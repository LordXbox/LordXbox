buy menu = space (put that in using csgo keyboard settings as i cant find a bind command for it) 

bind "mwheelup" +jump 
bind "mwheeldown" +jump 
bind - "say_team go win man" 
BindToggle f6 voice_enable 

// most keybinds are already in the autoexec.cfg file but add these in as well (except the top line obviously) 
you can do this by inputting them into autoexec.cfg and saving it as autoexec.cfg under all file types 
my DPI when playing is 800 with 2.5 as the ingame sensetivity
